Oblig1 = Is a mandatory assignment I have had. This is the assignment #1, and it's about to create a website with HTML & CSS + css grid. I left out Javascript due to I don't feel I am too comfortable with it yet. In fact, I still a beginner when it comes to Javascript. I think I still need more exercises within JS, HTML and CSS as well.

For this mandatory assignment, most of the codes I have done shall be repository here on GitHub. And since I am also new to Github, it's going to take awhile to get used to it, hopefully it will turn out well.
