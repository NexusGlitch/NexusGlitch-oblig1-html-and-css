# oblig#1 - UTVIKLING AV INTERAKTIVE NETTSIDER - Web development of Interactive Website

As a part of the mandatory assignment, the objective is to get refreshing for the web development skill. I feel like I have forgotten a lot of what I have learned from the past.
So, therefore, the purpose of this assignment is to become more skillful and try to write a lot of codes as possible in order to make it as a habit. Obtaining this new skill
is not easy, one must really be adapted and be ambious otherwise, it is a long and a bumpy road ahead. 
I still am a beginner despite of having sitting down and write codes for a while, I don't see myself as anything but good. 

As for this assignment, the teacher has already provided a layout instructure (a visual design sketch of what the layout of the website should look like) which the students had to follow.
